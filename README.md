# Risk Remover

A batch antivirus with MD5 scanning engine and (**discontinued**) filename scan. Additional features include safebrowsing which filters out **only top 20** harmful websites all-time classifying from the **URL** themselves and the ability to adjust or view the date and time.

## Getting Started

1. Go to the [Main Website](https://riskremove.blogspot.com) and click on the "Download" tab
2. Select the preferred version to download ( newest **recommended** )
3. Decompress (Unzip/Unrar) the downloaded file with winzip or winrar or 7-zip depending on your choice (Winrar **preferred**)
Note: Some versions come with an RAR-SFX executable so you must use winrar to automatically unzip/unrar them into the specified folder.
4. Run the startriskremover.bat to start the program. Take note that some old/legacy versions may not contain this file so, instead of running this file on the legacy versions, you might have to run a file that have similar naming scheme to this one.

### Prerequisites
